# FlxPedalV6-FlxPedalUi

This is the pedal user interface process launched by FlxMain.  It provides the user with a menu to browse effect combos and change effect parameters by writing to the LCD (using a small MCU) and reading the buttons and rotary encoder (for changing effect parameter values).  It uses request/response FIFOs and shared mapped memory for IPC with FlxMain.
